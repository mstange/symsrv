The `ShowSSEConfig` files in this directory were produced by the Firefox build system based on this code: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mozglue/tests/ShowSSEConfig.cpp

I obtained them on Feb 11, 2023, from the `target.crashreporter-symbols-full.tar.zstd` artifact of this Windows 64 shippable build:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/jobs?repo=mozilla-central&searchStr=windows%2Cshippable%2Cbuild&revision=54d29db98836c0779daac5e6362f227246ab9eb9&selectedTaskRun=AVQ-r0UmT7enjYRX8VI0YQ.0
I picked them because they were small.

I downloaded the cab-compressed files from the Mozilla symbol server, from https://symbols.mozilla.org/ShowSSEConfig.exe/63E6C7F78000/ShowSSEConfig.ex_ and https://symbols.mozilla.org/ShowSSEConfig.pdb/A62592418D7807494C4C44205044422E1/ShowSSEConfig.pd_ .
